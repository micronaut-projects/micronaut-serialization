To completely remove all dependencies on Jackson and use https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.5/javadoc/?org/bson/codecs/pojo/annotations/package-summary.html[BSON annotations] in your source code combined with BSON at a runtime you should replace the `micronaut-jackson-databind` and `micronaut-jackson-core` modules in your application with `micronaut-serde-bson`.

Add the following artifact to the `dependencies` block:

dependency:micronaut-serde-bson[groupId="io.micronaut.serde",scope="implementation"]

WARNING: If your third-party dependencies have direct dependencies on Jackson Databind it may not be an option to omit it.

With the correct dependencies in place you can now define an object to be serialized:

snippet::example.Book[project-base="doc-examples/example-bson", source="main"]

<1> The type is annotated with ann:serde.annotation.Serdeable[] to enable serialization/deserialization
<2> You can use `@BsonProperty` from BSON annotations
<3> You can use `@BsonCreator` from BSON annotations

Once you have a type that can be serialized and deserialized you can use the api:serde.ObjectMapper[] interface to do so:

snippet::example.BookTest[project-base="doc-examples/example"]
