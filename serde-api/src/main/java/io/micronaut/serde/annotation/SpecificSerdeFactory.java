 * Marks the generated singleton serializer or deserializer that creates a build-time generated serde, which takes
 * the encoder or decoder context and the type as constructor arguments, for every specific serde.
 *
 * <p>The registry selects it the way it selects a serde bean created with the context and the type: only for its
 * exact type, and not when a deserialization pre-instantiate callback is present.</p>
